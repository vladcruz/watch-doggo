## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in WatchDoggo or any Zyra Engineering open-source project:

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue.**  
Instead, contact our security team directly at:

📧 **cristiano [at] zyraeng [dot] com**

Your email should include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any proof of concept or sample payloads (if applicable).
- Possible impact or severity (if known).

## ⚙️ What Happens Next

1. We will **acknowledge receipt** of your report within 48 hours.  
2. The team will **investigate, validate, and prioritize** the issue internally.  
3. Once confirmed, we will:
   - Develop a patch or fix.
   - Coordinate disclosure with you (if desired).
   - Release a secure version and document the fix in release notes.

We aim to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities **within 7–14 days**, depending on complexity.

---

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

Please:
- Avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities before a fix is released.
- Avoid testing exploits on production environments or user data.
- Use ethical reporting practices that protect end users.

If you wish, you’ll be **credited** in the release notes for responsible discovery.

## 🛡️ Commitment to Security

WatchDoggo follows the security principles we apply across all Zyra Engineering projects:
- Minimal dependency footprint.
- Sanitized service parsing.
- Environment-isolated logging and configuration.
- Clear separation of config and secrets.

Your reports help us maintain that standard.  
Thank you for contributing to a more secure ecosystem ❤️
